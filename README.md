# Vaccine_Efficacy
This project presents the program and data used in the article: "Time-Dependent Vaccine Efficacy Estimation Quantified by a Mathematical Model".

Program in Python associated with the generation of vaccination scenarios in the study of estimated vaccine efficacy.

The project members are Eduardo Massad, Jorge P. Zubelli, Vinicius Albani, Francisco A. B. Coutinho, Dimas T. Covas, Claudio J. Struchiner and Jennifer Loria.

## Repository contents
There are two folders: Data and Program. 

In the Data folder we have two excels with the data used in the program: Santos and Coronavac. Santos contains the data on deaths and cases of Covid-19 from February 26, 2020 to October 16, 2020 in the city of Santos, São Paulo. These data were obtained from https://www.seade.gov.br/coronavirus/ . Coronavac contains data on the number of people who got placebo and the number who got vaccinated during the clinical study of the second dose of Coronavac vaccine. FECHA These data were provided by the Instituto Butantan for the preparation of the paper: "Time-Dependent Vaccine Efficacy Estimation Quantified by a Mathematical Model" and we have their respective authorization letter, which is also in the folder.

In the Program folder we have three programs developed in Python.
